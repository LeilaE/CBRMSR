Description: CBRMSR is Case Based Reasoning with Multi-Stage Retrieval. The package allows for splitting or folding, feature selection with a balanced iterative random forest or random KNN algorithm, and class  balancing with ADASYN or SMOTE. Distance matrices can be created on confounding variable data, and numeric predictor variable data. During retrieval, cases are retrieved using a confidence metric that automaticallyretrieves cases for each test case until a confidence threshold is reached. First, cases are retrieved fromsimilar confounding attributes, followed by retrieving from similar predictor attributes.
